msgid "*Enable simple view*: The simple view in the metadata editor/viewer: - removes much of the hierarchy from nested metadata records (such as ISO19115/19139) - will not let the user add metadata elements that are not already in the metadata record It is intended to provide a flat, simple view of the metadata record. A disadvantage of the simple view is that some of the context information supplied by the nesting in the metadata record is lost. *Enable ISO view*: The ISO19115/19139 metadata standard defines three groups of elements: - Minimum: those elements that are mandatory - Core: the elements that should be present in any metadata record describing a geographic dataset - All: all the elements *Enable INSPIRE view*: Enables the metadata element groups defined in the EU INSPIRE directive. *Enable XML view*: This is a raw text edit view of the XML record. You can disable this if (for example), you don't want inexperienced users to be confused by the XML presentation provided by this view."

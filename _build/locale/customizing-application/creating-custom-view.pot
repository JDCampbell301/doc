msgid "By default the initial view is an AngularJS view on the results returned from the search service. Therefore the view can only contain the fields from the Lucene Index. If you require more fields, you can either add fields to the index or don't use the AngularJS view. This view is defined in :code:`web-ui/src/main/resources/catalog/views/default/templates/recordView.html`."

msgid "After having created a new formatter you will have to update your application code, so the new formatter-output can be visualised from your application. If the goal of the formatter is to introduce a new html view on metadata, then you can add a reference to it in :code:`web-ui/src/main/resources/catalog/views/default/config.js` (searchSettings.formatter.list)."

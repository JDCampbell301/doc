msgid "A catalog can define a set of categories that can be used to classify metadata records for easy searching or managment purposes (see :ref:`managing-categories`). Categories will not be added to the metadata records itself and as such may not be exported when the record is harvested (eg. when using CSW protocol). If the category needs to be propagated with the metadata, use other harvesting protocols (eg. GeoNetwork) or use keywords (see :ref:`tagging-with-keywords`)."

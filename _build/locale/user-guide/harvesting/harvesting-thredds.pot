msgid "THREDDS catalogs describe inventories of datasets. They are organised in a hierarchical manner, listing descriptive information and access methods for each dataset. They typically catalog netCDF datasets but are not restricted to these types of files.  This harvesting type crawls through a THREDDS catalog harvesting metadata for datasets and services described in it or in referenced netCDF datasets. This harvesting type can extract fragments of metadata from the THREDDS catalog, allowing the user to link or copy these fragments into a template to create metadata records."

The other stylesheet, netcdf-attributes.xsl, is for generating iso19139 fragments from netCDF datasets following Unidata dataset discovery conventions. These stylesheets are designed for use with the 'HARVESTING TEMPLATE â€“ THREDDS â€“ DATA DISCOVERY' template and can be found in the schema 'convert' directory eg. for ISO19139 this is ``GEONETWORK_DATA_DIR/config/schema_plugins/iso19139/convert/ThreddsToFragments``."

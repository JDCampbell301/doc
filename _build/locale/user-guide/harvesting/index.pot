msgid "For every new record, a UUID is generated and assigned to it."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/user-guide/harvesting/index.rst:46
msgid "Another important concept behind the harvesting is the ``last change date``. Every time you change a metadata record, the last change date is updated. Just storing this parameter and comparing it with a new one allows any system to find out if the metadata record has been modified since last update."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/user-guide/harvesting/index.rst:51
msgid "These two concepts allow catalogs to fetch remote metadata, check if it has been updated and remove it locally if it has been removed remotely. UUIDs also allowed cross catalog harvesting in case B harvests from C and A harvests from B."

msgid "GeoNetwork 2.1 introduced a new powerful harvesting engine which is not compatible with GeoNetwork version 2.0 based catalogues. Old 2.0 servers can still harvest from 2.1 servers but harvesting metadata from a v2.0 server requires this harvesting type. Due to the fact that GeoNetwork 2.0 was released more than 5 years ago, this harvesting type is deprecated."

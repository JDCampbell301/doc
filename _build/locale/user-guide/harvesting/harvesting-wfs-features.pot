msgid "Metadata can be present in the tables of a relational databases, which are commonly used by many organisations. Putting an OGC Web Feature Service (WFS) over a relational database will allow metadata to be extracted via standard query mechanisms. This harvesting type allows the user to specify a GetFeature query and map information from the features to fragments of metadata that can be linked or copied into a template to create metadata records."

GeoNetwork, acting as a client, can read the GetFeature response and apply a user-supplied XSLT stylesheet to produce metadata fragments that can be linked or copied into a user-supplied template to build metadata records."

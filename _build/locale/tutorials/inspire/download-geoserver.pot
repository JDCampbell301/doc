Configuring appschema support in GeoServer is not the goal of this tutorial. Appschema support for INSPIRE is nicely documented by `Marcus Sen <https://data.gov.uk/sites/default/files/library/INSPIREWFSCookbook_v1.0.pdf>`_. Another valuable resource is available at `geosolutions <http://www.geo-solutions.it/blog/inspire-support-in-geoserver-made-easy-with-hale/>`_. In this tutorial we'll focus on metadata aspects of a WFS download service."

msgid "The tutorials in this section target specific GeoNetwork implementation scenarios related to the `European INSPIRE Directive <http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/>`_. INSPIRE mandates European organisations to set up view- and download services and to describe them using metadata in discovery services. To respond to all aspects of the technical guidelines requires to compose an infrastructure of various components. For now we provide tutorials for view services in `mapserver <view-mapserver.rst>`_ and `geoserver <view-geoserver.rst>`_ and download services using `Atom <download-atom.rst>`_ and `geoserver <download-geoserver.rst>`_."

msgid "The basics of Atom/OpenSearch is that for each dataset a number of file-downloads in various flavours (language/projection/format) is available. These flavours are advertised in a \"Dataset Atom Feed\" document. A set of \"Dataset Atom Feed\" documents is grouped into a \"Service Atom Feed\" document. For each \"Service Atom Feed\" document an OpenSearchDescription document is available. A website can refer to this OpenSearchDescription document, which enables searching through the download service using the browser search bar (OpenSearch)."

msgid "Currently only the external mode is fully supported. Atom files can be generated in any text or xml editor following the technical guidelines. To optimise the Atom support GeoNetwork uses a convention, which is currently not mandated by the technical guidelines. The convention is that any gmd:MD_Distribution having a link to an Atom file requires the protocol field to contain a defined value to indicate the distribution as being an Atom document. Default value for this protocol is INSPIRE-ATOM, but you can change it using Admin > Settings. The benefit of this approach is that GeoNetwork doesn't need to open any file-link to determine if it is an Atom File. We've seen various member states mandate this convention in localised INSPIRE Technical Guidelines."

In this file \"schemas/iso19139/src/main/plugin/iso19139/loc/eng/labels.xml \" (and the same file in other languages in use in the catalogue) in the gmd:protocol helper (around line 2000) add the \"INSPIRE-ATOM\" protocol which is used to indicate links that link to an Atom file (only links having that protocol value will be ingested)."

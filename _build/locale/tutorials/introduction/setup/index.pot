The default administrator user is called *admin* and the password is *admin*. Once you have logged in, you have to enter the administration console to configure the basics."

#: ../../source/tutorials/introduction/setup/index.rst:30
msgid "Preferred protocol should be https as that will mean a secure navigation for your users but http is the default one for easy deployment and development. **No login should be made outside the https protocol** for security reasons. Using https protocol on a strict browser policy like on Firefox may mean that some http map services will be blocked and display an error if trying to be loaded on the map. This can be solved by using only https map services. As http is a deprecated protocol, this problem will be solved in time. Check with your map service provider to use https with a valid certificate for the map services."
